# Dope Daily Planner
A daily planner to save all your daily planning needs.

## HTML
* The HTML mainly consists of the starter code we were given for the assignment.
* I added a bootstrap table to hold my times, input boxes, and buttons.
* I have basic containers in order to store my dynamic HTML elements through javascript/jquery
* I have links to my CDN's for bootstrap, and APi's like Google Fonts and Font Awesome.
* I have my script tags for Jquery and Moment,js

## CSS
* My CSS mainly consists of the starter code we were given for the assignment.
* I added classes and ID's dynamically through javascript and jquery.
* I assigned my created elements to pre existing classes through javascript and jquery.

## JavaScript/ JQuery/ Moment.js
* This project's functionality is created with a mixture of Vanilla JavaScript and JQuery.
* This application also uses Moment.js for real time functionality.
* The current day is displayed on the top of the planner.
* The time slots, input boxes, and buttons are generated dynamically.
* The time slots are color-coded representing past, present, and future (gray, red, and green respectively.)
* The information typed in the input boxes is stored in local storage upon click of the save button and the information is still displayed upon refresh.
